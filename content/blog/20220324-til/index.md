I tend to come across cool projects, interesting documentation, and create other
oddities and experiments. On Thursdays, I'm going to roll them up into a series
that I'm calling Thursday I Learned.


## Interesting Projects
Anthony Fu (noteably a vue/vite/nuxt contributor and all around cool guy) 
has a css theme for prism that uses CSS vars instead of SCSS, if you're a fan of
dark modes, I tried playing with it on my blog this week and can certainly recommend

https://github.com/antfu/prism-theme-vars

## New utilities

Something I'm considering integrating into my blog, comment below if you think
you would use it! ...oh wait... No comments system.
